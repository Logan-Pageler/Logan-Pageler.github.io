								My name is Logan Pageler, and I am a Junior at
								the University of Arizona. Currently I am on
								track to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science
								in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Math with
								a Computer Science emphasis in the spring of
								2024. I am planning to graduate with a Masters
								in Computer Science in the spring of 2025
								through the University of Arizona's accelerated
								masters program. I am mainly interested in
								recently developed technologies including A.I.
								and quantum computing.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I enjoy spending time outside too. Some of my
								main hobbies include running, rock climbing, and
								camping. I also enjoy giving back to the
								community. I like to participate in road
								cleanups, and build houses for Habitat for
								Humanity.

						&emsp; I first started experimenting with Artificial
						Intelligence at the start of my sophomore year of
						highschool. My first project was a very simple
						evolutionary AI programmed from scratch in Java. I
						trained a group of dots to slowly travel the length of
						the screen, all while avoiding obstacles. My eyes lit up
						when they first made it to the goal. However, I quickly
						became bored with the dots and moved to more advance
						algorithms.

							&emsp; I moved on to Neural Networks. My first
							iteration was supervised learning Neural Network
							that used gradient decent to increase it's accuracy.
							The entire project was also programmed from scratch
							in java. I trained the network to recognized
							checkerboard patterns and binary numbers. I about
							fell out of my seat the night it finally got a 95%
							accuracy on checkerboards. However, I quickly ran
							out of tests for it so I decided to give it an
							upgrade.
							<br />
							<br />
							&emsp; My next goal was to perform unsupervised
							learning through Q-Learning and my existing neural
							network. It took me several month of perseverance to
							get the model to function properly. The only
							application I trained it to do was to drift around a
							track I had made. I couldn't believe my eyes when I
							woke up one morning (after letting my computer train
							all night for the millionth time) to seeing a car
							zipping around a track all on its own.

						&emsp; Nowadays, I rely on libraries for my AI projects.
						I have built and worked with a variety of AIs to
						categorize Images, recognize text, understand speach,
						and much more. However, since starting to use libraries,
						these projects have become much easier, so I have
						decided to combine them all into one mega-assitant AI.
						<br /><br />
						&emsp; My next project I have been working on is a smart
						home AI that can adjust to my behaviors. There's many
						features I want to implement, but for starters I want it
						to be able to recognize when someone introduces
						themselves, and create a profile for them to recognize
						them by face and voice. My next goal would be to add
						room following, where it knows what room of the house
						people are in. Then it can do things like make their
						music follow them. My two biggest hiccups right now are
						time, and also I wanted to switch from TensorFlow to
						PyTorch since it is much better supported.

						&emsp; I took my first web design class in 6th grade.
						Since then, I have been working on websites of many
						different sizes. The three frameworks I am most
						confident in are Angular, React, and Vue. I have worked
						on both Angular and React websites professionally. I
						also have a lot of experience writing in raw HTML and JS
						such as this website. I am also a fan of HTTPS protocol,
						as I have created a website entirely through sockets in
						Java.

							&emsp; One of my most recent websites was a Excel
							file editor. I designed it with three major parts.
							It has a Vue frontend, with a python backend, and
							AWS for a database. It is also complete with Google
							authentication to create sessions. I had a lot of
							fun designing it, especially learning the
							integration of the three parts. The code is
							available on my Git Hub, but it is incomplete for
							security reasons. That is, my specific AWS token and
							Google token are not present on Git Hub.

						&emsp; Shapemon was my teams final project for the class
						introduction to computer programming in my freshman year
						of high school. The code is definitely a mess, and this
						project was a huge learning experience but none the
						less, the game is pretty fun.
						<br />
						<br />
						&emsp; I drew half the assets, and one of my friends did
						the other half (I think? But also maybe they just took
						them from online because they look scarily similar to
						pokemon emerald). There were 3 people in our group who
						worked on the code. I was in charge of the map and
						graphics, one friends was in charge of battling, and the
						other was in charge of the inventory. Although I have
						made a few changes since its submission (fixing game
						breaking bugs) but I tried to leave the original
						structure the same. (As much as hurts because of its
						messiness).

							&emsp; While Shapemon may not be a good
							representation of my current programming
							capabilities, it is definitely an amazing
							representation of my passion for coding. With very
							limited tools under my belt, I spent multitudes of
							hours to finish the project in under just one month.
							I easily coded away most of my spring break that
							year. I spent on average 4 hours programming every
							day for that month, on top of my other school work.
							I easily stayed up past midnight most nights to work
							on it. Ultimately the project is one I'm quite proud
							of, (even though it pains me to know that I stuffed
							12k lines into 1 file) and I hope to work on many
							more large scale projects in the future.
							<br />

							&emsp; Shapemon is available for view and download
							on my Git Hub under the repository shapemon.
